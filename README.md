I used mt-1 to space the top of "Book Your Flight Here" & m-3

I had an issue with the radio buttons on the flight checking form. The Flight Type and the Flight Grade classed because they we all shared the same NAME - changing names of elements to fit their group solves this problem.

The "Find Flights" button is intentionally longer than the "Clear All" button to draw attention to its importance.

I styled the placeholder on the flight form using "input::placeholder" to target the element.

I used large / larger font-size for both the navbar & btn to add more motion to the site
